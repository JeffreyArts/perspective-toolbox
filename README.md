# Toolbox

This repo is a public repository of a personal workflow. It is made to provide a scaffolding for developing concepts, prototypes, or standalone tools. It is up to the user to give it shape to its own likings. But in the basis it is running Vue, with vue-router. Further more has already included some modules that I tend to enjoy using in my personal practice.t
