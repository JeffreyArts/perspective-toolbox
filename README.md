# Perpsective Toolbox

This repo is a public repository of some digital experiments related to an artistic project I am developing on the subject of perceptions. More on this will follow in the future. For now, you can pull this repo. Run `yarn install` & `yarn run dev`. This will show you a dashboard with various experiments made with ThreeJS
